# Database Sidebar Presentation

## Scope

- Dense database-list presentation.
- In-memory sidebar filtering.
- Database-row status text and scan-root readouts.

## Current State

- The sidebar presents database games as a dense flat native list.
- Duplicate game titles are disambiguated in the visible label with system text only when needed.
- Sidebar filtering runs in memory over loaded game rows rather than issuing live recursive filesystem work.
- Game selection status text is standardized as `name • N tracks`.
- Library scan-root status text is standardized as enabled state, display order, indexed track count, and last completed scan time or error.
- Sidebar presentation helpers now live in a dedicated helper rather than inline throughout the main view model.

## Rules

- Keep dense-list presentation behavior separate from queue mutation and playback control.
- Keep sidebar filtering effectively instant.
- Keep row-status text and scan-root readouts centralized so wording changes do not drift across call sites.
